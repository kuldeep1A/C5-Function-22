@1. Create Number Guessing Game By Python
The number guessing game is a popular game among programmers. In the number guessing game, the program selects a random number between two numbers, and the user guesses the correct number.

@2. Create a Higher and lower foller in instagram Game by Python

FAQ: Why does choice B always become choice A in every round, even when A had more followers? 

Suppose you just started the game and you are comparing the followers of A - Instagram (364k) to B - Selena Gomez (174k). Instagram has more followers, so choice A is correct. However, the subsequent comparison should be between Selena Gomez (the new A) and someone else. The reason is that everything in our list has fewer followers than Instagram. If we were to keep Instagram as part of the comparison (as choice A) then Instagram would stay there for the rest of the game. This would be quite boring. By swapping choice B for A each round, we avoid a situation where the number of followers of choice A keeps going up over the course of the game. Hope that makes sense :-)

@3. Create My Coffee machine Using Python

A real coffee machine doesn't have an infinite supply of water, milk, or coffee beans. And if you input a really big number, it's almost certain that a real coffee machine wouldn't have the supplies needed to make all that coffee for you. In this stage, you need to improve the previous program. Now you will check amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans available in your coffee machine at the moment.

Like in the previous stage, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans to make one cup of coffee.

@4. Create Quiz game Using Python (OOPs concepts are clear)
They have three chances to answer each question you don't want to take the quiz too difficult. Each correct answer will score a point. At the end of the game, the program will reveal the player's final score.

@5. Create a Hirst Painting Using Python (You must be clear turtle in python)
Hirstâ€™s spots follow a number of specific rules: The spots must be uniform in size, hand-painted in a perfect circle, and positioned in a grid. Almost always, every spot in a work will be a different color (and the spots are rarely black).
